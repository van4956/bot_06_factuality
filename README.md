## Notes

"Factfulness" is a book summarizing years of research by Hans Rosling, a professor of international health.  
The author conducted fact-based tests among students, politicians, scientists, and even Nobel Prize laureates around the world.

Most participants - regardless of education or professional background - scored worse than if they had chosen answers at random.  
Rosling illustrates this using an example with a chimpanzee choosing one of three bananas: on average, the chimp guessed 4 out of 13 answers correctly, while humans picked only 2–3 out of 13.

This highlights how even experts are subject to cognitive biases and stereotypes.

Hans Rosling explains key cognitive biases and instincts that make us distort reality, and provides advice on how to think more rationally.

The test is based on data collected by the author for the book.  
Each question highlights widespread misconceptions about global trends such as poverty, education, and healthcare.
